# Remote-Sensing
Handheld NDVI sensing devices generate raw data across multiple growth stages, which can be challenging to interpret due to their volume and complexity. To address this, I developed a visualization approach that compiles NDVI data from all stages under both irrigated and drought conditions into a single image, providing a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the crop's response.
